# 🎃 Postman API-First Hacktoberfest for Students - 2021

This Hacktoberfest we are mixing it up - YOU get to create and maintain an open source repo (or work together with friends).

The challenge will be to build either an API or a website that consumes the API. The interface for the API has already been designed: it is a **Halloween Costume Contest API**, that allows you to create, read, update, delete and upvote constume party contestants.

See the OpenAPI schema for this API in the "API" tab:
[Show me the schema!](https://postman.postman.co/workspace/Postman-Hacktoberfest'21-~1ae1036b-6583-4883-949e-adf8b55687a1/overview)

## What is API-First? 

API-First is the philosophy of defining an API before writing any code for a server or frontend. The routes, parameters, responses and other traits of an API can be clearly defined with a schema. You can think of a schema as a blueprint for an API. 

With a schema as a single source of truth, teams can move quickly with a “divide and conquer” approach to building applications. For example, frontend developers can code a website that hits a mock server that returns fake data of the expected shape, without having to wait for the backend team to build a real server. Meanwhile, the backend team can start coding a server against tests that check that the API schema is being followed correctly. 

There are several specification formats for defining an API schema. One is called [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) (previously known as Swagger), which we are using in this event to define the Halloween Costume Contest API! 

Postman provides you with the tools you need to develop with an API-First approach. From an API schema, you can auto-generate mock servers, tests, documentation, and even server code. See more about how Postman can help you drive an API-First development lifecycle [here](https://www.postman.com/use-cases/api-first-development/).


## Rules

- Must follow our Code of Conduct

## How to participate

### 1. Sign up for Postman's Hacktoberfest 
Sign up with [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiqnbbSSA5a3ifzoTcebEFo5wvPFtAWt5LKboWu3cEi8JGCg/viewform). This will keep you in the loop with workshop accouncements and updates!

### 2. [Optional] Sign up for Hacktoberfest (by DigitalOcean)

DigitalOcean hosts this event each year and awards limited edition T-Shirts to applicants who **make 4 pull requests during the month of October**.  

*\* Note: T-Shirts available only for the first 55,000 participants*


### 3. Choose your path!

Do you want to build an API or a Website? 👀

Pick one and find instructions and requirements in these starter repos:

**[=> I want to build an API (backend)](https://github.com/Postman-Student-Program/hacktoberfest21-backend-repo-template
)**

**[=> I want to build a Website (frontend)](https://github.com/Postman-Student-Program/hacktoberfest21-frontend-repo-template
)**

*\* if you are planning to work on a team, only one person needs to fork the starter repo. This person will become the repo Maintainer*

### 4. Submit your repo 

Submit your repo [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeg8BVdg3fzuhwgBiM6AXR_NOEKI-w_Q8uG5eBVpfyVZmggXw/viewform), once you've completed building an API or Website that meets the requirements!

If a repo had multiple contributors, each contributor should submit the same repo separately.
