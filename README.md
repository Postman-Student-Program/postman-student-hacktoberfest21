# ðŸŽƒ Postman Student API-First Hacktoberfest'21 

This Hacktoberfest we are mixing it up - YOU get to create and maintain an open source repo (or work together with friends).

The challenge will be to build either an API or a website that consumes the API. The interface for the API has already been designed: it is a **Halloween Costume Contest API**, that allows you to create, read, update, delete and upvote constume party contestants.

See the OpenAPI schema for this API in the "API" tab:
[Show me the schema!](https://postman.postman.co/workspace/Postman-Hacktoberfest'21-~1ae1036b-6583-4883-949e-adf8b55687a1/overview)

## What is API-First? 

API-First is the philosophy of **designing an API before writing ANY code**. This design is documented a **schema**.

### What is a schema?

A **schema** is the blueprint of an API. The schema defines exactly what routes the API will have, what kind of parameters to expect, and what type of responses the API will return.

Imagine a team building a house without a [blueprint](http://www.designdepotinc.com/understanding-blueprints/). It would be chaos! The plumber would have to wait for the carpenters to start building the flooring and walls before they could guess where to install the shower and how much piping to procur. The painter wouldn't know how much paint to get. The electrician might buy the wrong type and number of wall sockets. To prevent this chaos, the first task in the house building process is to design a blueprint. This blueprint helps everyone on the team know exactly what is being built before any work starts, allowing people to divide and conquer toward a common goal. 

In the same way, designing an API's schema first allows teams to get on the same page about what is being built.


## Rules

### 2. [Optional] Sign up for Hacktoberfest (by DigitalOcean)

DigitalOcean hosts this event each year and awards limited edition T-Shirts to applicants who **make 4 pull requests during the month of October**.  

*\* Note: T-Shirts available only for the first 55,000 participants*


### 3. Choose your path!

Do you want to build an API or a Website? ðŸ‘€

Pick one and find instructions and requirements in these starter repos:

**[=> I want to build an API (backend)](https://github.com/Postman-Student-Program/hacktoberfest21-backend-repo-template
)**

**[=> I want to build a Website (frontend)](https://github.com/Postman-Student-Program/hacktoberfest21-frontend-repo-template
)**

*\* if you are planning to work on a team, only one person needs to fork the starter repo. This person will become the repo Maintainer*

### 4. Submit your repo 

Submit your repo [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeg8BVdg3fzuhwgBiM6AXR_NOEKI-w_Q8uG5eBVpfyVZmggXw/viewform), once you've completed building an API or Website that meets the requirements!

If a repo had multiple contributors, each contributor should submit the same repo separately.
